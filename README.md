## Description

This is a website designed to advice veiwers on how to dress appropriately for a black tie dress code. It shows all the different pieces that should be worn and informs them of the way to wear each item and which are the correct ones to be worn, it also informs them about the history of black tie and how it came to be.

This idea was due to my part time job as a sales representetive at a hackett store where many customers who came to buy suits for black tie dress code had no idea about the kind of things which they needed for this dress code so I thought an informative webpage on the do's and don'ts for this would be useful to them.

## UX

---

My goal in the design was to make it very traditional and antique but with a minimalistic approach as I didn't want too much clutter. Hence a grey/white/cream theme was used to create the antique feel as it is trying to represent a classic topic.
User stories:
 - I am looking to learn more about the history of black tie attire.
 - I am looking to have visual clueas as to which type of accesories are suitable to use with a black tie.
 - I am looking to see which jackets are viable to go with a black tie dress code.
 - I want to know the full atire which should be used in a black tie dress code as I am completely unfamiliar with it.

## Credits

### content:
 - The contents are about black tie and were written off my own knowledge from previous work in a menswear store, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie was used to help me explain the history aspect.

### media:
 - Most of the photos were taken from https://www.hackett.com/gb/home with 1 photo from https://www.prada.com/gb/en/men/shoes/lace-ups.html, this is because I was unable to find suitable photos elsewhere on open source websites and so have credited these website in the footer.

### Acknowledgements:
 - I used W3schools and the boostrap website to help with dividing my colums properly and making the cards in the accesories section.
